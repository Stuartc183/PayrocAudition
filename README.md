# PayrocAudition

On viewing the task for this audition I noticed that the task was set in 2006.
I have made the assumption that I can use things that were not around at that time, things like aspnet core, entity framework, auto mapper, MVC etc.
I have also not been around as much as I would like to be to complete this task, but due to starting our holiday last Thursday
I have had family commitments over the weekend.
I have created an API to handle the backend of this task.
The back end will take the url and generate a 6 digit alpha numeric code, which gets stored along with the url.
The url can then be retreieved using this code as a querystring parameter.

I have not completed the ui side of the task yet.  I will continue to do so purely as an excercise, as it has been some considerable time
since I have done any ui work and definitely need to take a refresher.

The code that I have completed runs and displays a swagger document to interact with.

I apologise for not being able to fully complete and for the code if you feel it has been rushed, but that was the only way I have been able to
get the work to you this morning.

Thank you for your consideration
